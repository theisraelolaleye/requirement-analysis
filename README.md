# Introduction
This project is about understanding the concept of requirement analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a critical role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the software being built truly meets the needs of its stakeholders. Below are some key reasons why it is important:

1. **Clarity and Understanding**  
   It helps eliminate ambiguity by ensuring all stakeholders and developers share the same understanding of what the system should do. This prevents misinterpretation of requirements.

2. **Scope Definition**  
   Requirement Analysis defines the boundaries of the project. By clearly identifying what is in scope and what is not, it helps prevent scope creep — the uncontrolled addition of features during development.

3. **Basis for Design and Development**  
   It provides a solid foundation for the design and development phases. Without a well-defined set of requirements, developers risk building a system that doesn’t align with user needs.

4. **Cost and Time Estimation**  
   With clear requirements, teams can better estimate project timelines, allocate resources, and forecast costs accurately.

5. **Quality Assurance**  
   Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher user satisfaction and reduced risk of project failure.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis consists of five main activities that ensure the requirements are well-defined, structured, and validated. These activities include:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  - Collect requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and document analysis.  
  - Helps capture the initial needs and expectations of the system.  

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  - Refine and expand gathered requirements using brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and prototyping.  
  - Ensures that requirements are clear, complete, and aligned with stakeholder goals.  

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  - Record requirements in structured formats such as Requirement Specification Documents, user stories, or use cases.  
  - Provides a written reference that guides design, development, and testing.  

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  - Analyze requirements to prioritize them and check their feasibility against technical, financial, and time constraints.  
  - Create models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize system processes and interactions.  

- **Requirement Validation**  
  - Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.  
  - Define acceptance criteria and establish traceability to verify that all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
